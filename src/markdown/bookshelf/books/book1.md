Time of reading: _July 2024 - August 2024_

The book dives into big themes like power, religion, and ecology, but it’s also packed with action, complex characters, and world-building. It can be a bit slow at times, but once you’re in, it’s an epic tale that sticks with you. If you’re into deep, thought-provoking sci-fi, Dune is definitely worth checking out.

The two first books are the best.
