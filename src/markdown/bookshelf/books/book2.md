Time of reading: _August 2024 - August 2024_

Compared to the first book, Dune Messiah is darker and more introspective. It’s less about big battles and desert survival, and more about the cost of power and Paul trying to balance his responsibilities with the things he's lost along the way. Some readers find it slower and more philosophical, but if you’re into the more thoughtful side of the Dune universe, it’s a fascinating follow-up.

Also, my favourite book in the series.
