Time of reading: some time in 2021

The novel is both hilarious and touching, mixing comedy with deeper themes about idealism, reality, and the clash between fantasy and the real world. Don Quixote's delusions get him into all sorts of trouble, but you can’t help but root for him. It’s a long read, but its humor, clever commentary, and memorable characters make it one of the most beloved works of literature.
