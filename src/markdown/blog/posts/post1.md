## New looks and new feels

Lately I’ve been going through a major shift in my career — moving from pure 
programming to the world of automotive engineering and electronics. At first, 
it was hard to let go of the software-heavy projects I was used to. But nothing 
compares to the feeling of watching something you built move, literally, 
at 50 km/h inside a Baja SAE vehicle. That moment changes everything.

I’ve always been a petrolhead. I love driving, I love cars, and — although I only 
realized it recently — I always had in me the potential to become an engineer. 
Joining the Mangue Baja team made everything click. It was as if someone finally 
wiped the fog off the window I’d been trying to look through for years.

Now that I’ve found what I truly want to do, work doesn’t feel like work anymore. 
It doesn’t drain me, and it never feels like a chore. I’m excited — genuinely excited 
— to design new ECUs, to test electronics, and to help my team build the best car we possibly can.

And that’s when I realized something important:
a Baja project isn’t just “a project.” It’s a _way of life_. It changes how you think, 
how you work, how you grow. It turns engineering into passion, and passion into purpose.
