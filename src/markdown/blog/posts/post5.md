## My experience studying classical music

Being a musician is one of the worst choices one can make, you are sentencing yourself to being a 
glorified looser. This being said, I am trying to become a musician, classical guitar to be specific, 
studying guitar alone and becoming a intermediate player is cool, but becoming a true classical guitar is 
a experience of lots of pain and little joy. It sucks.

Music is supposed to be fun, but well, maybe this bad feeling is just a vibe, it will pass.
