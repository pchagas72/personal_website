## My experience with music so far

Being a musician sometimes sucks, your ego will be shattered to pieces as frequently as it can be.

After all, as a classical musician, you try to reach perfection, and this is never healthy. But, if you have the mindset that _you will screw up a **lot**_, things will go a bit more smoothly.

I thought that I was a great guitar player, but man, I was wrong. But I'm getting better and better every day. 
That's the right way to think about getting destroyed by classical teachers.
