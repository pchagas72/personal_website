[["\u003ccenter\u003e\n\n## New looks and new feels\n### 02/dec/2025\n\n\u003c/center\u003e\n\nLately I’ve been going through a major shift in my career — moving from pure \nprogramming to the world of automotive engineering and electronics. At first, \nit was hard to let go of the software-heavy projects I was used to. But nothing \ncompares to the feeling of watching something you built move, literally, \nat 50 km/h inside a Baja SAE vehicle. That moment changes everything.\n\nI’ve always been a petrolhead. I love driving, I love cars, and — although I only \nrealized it recently — I always had in me the potential to become an engineer. \nJoining the Mangue Baja team made everything click. It was as if someone finally \nwiped the fog off the window I’d been trying to look through for years.\n\nNow that I’ve found what I truly want to do, work doesn’t feel like work anymore. \nIt doesn’t drain me, and it never feels like a chore. I’m excited — genuinely excited \n— to design new ECUs, to test electronics, and to help my team build the best car we possibly can.\n\nAnd that’s when I realized something important:\na Baja project isn’t just “a project.” It’s a _way of life_. It changes how you think, \nhow you work, how you grow. It turns engineering into passion, and passion into purpose.\n\n![BAJA SAE NORDESTE 2025](https://github.com/pchagas72/personal_website/blob/main/src/assets/blog/BAJA%20SAE%20NORDESTE%202025.webp?raw=true)\n","\n New looks and new feels","\n 02/dec/2025"]]
