## Welcome to my classical guitar repertoire

Here I wish to post **only** the songs that I "perfected" in the __Pernambuco Music Conservatory__.

I do this because, the more I learned, I noticed that yes, I can play a lot of songs, but the performing aspect lacked some crucial details, such as correct left hand finger positions.

For that, I'll post here the pieces that were approved and presented to my teachers at the conservatory. Eventually, I plan on posting my performances.
