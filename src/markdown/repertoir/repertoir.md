## Welcome to my classical guitar repertoir

Here I wish to post **only** the songs that I "perfected" in the __Pernambuco Music Conservatoir__.

I do this because, the more I learned, I noticed that yes, I can play a lot of songs, but the performing aspect lacked some crutial details, such as correct left hand finger positions.

For that, I put here only the pieces that were approved and presented to my teachers at the Conservatoir, eventually I plan on posting my performances.
